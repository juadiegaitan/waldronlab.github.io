Many bioinformatic resources must be run from the command line, also referred to as the shell or terminal. "*nix" refers to Linux/Unix, but a terminal can also be used from OSX and even Windows. 

Regular Expressions (regexes) are included here even though they are widely useful in R and other programming languages for powerful string matching.

- [Software Carpentry][]{:target="_blank"} - very nice self-guided tutorials on the essentials of the command line. This is a good starting point.
- [RegExr][]{:target="_blank"} - Great site for beginners to practice regexes, and experts to build complicated regexes. It lets you build and see the results of your expression instantly, with help on the side-bar.

[Coursera][]{:target="_blank"} is an online platform for learning.

The courses are free to sign up and should be accessed via direct link or from the search function on the website.

*Note:* You do __not__ have to complete the course although it is a __good idea__ to have the certificate of completion.

The [DataScience Specialization][]{:target="_blank"} from [Johns Hopkins University][]{:target="_blank"} is a great set of courses that can be
taken to enhance your skills working with and interpreting data.

Particularly, the [R Programming][]{:target="_blank"} course is one of the easier ways to getting started using R.
Please see the direct link to the course.

The DataScience Specialization team also has a dedicated [website][]{:target="_blank"} (much like this one) to provide useful
resources and links.

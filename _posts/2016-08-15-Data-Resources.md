A lot of the work of our lab involves accessing, wrangling, and re-distributing public data resources. Here are a few resources that may be good to know about.

- [HMP][]{:target="_blank"}: Tips from the Huttenhower lab on making use of data from the Human Microbiome Project
- [BiocInterfaces][]{:target="_blank"}: tools by Marcel Ramos to help interface TCGA data with Bioconductor. Useful little utility functions like a TCGA barcode translator.
- [TCGACodeTables][]{:target="_blank"}: A fork of TCGA barcode tables, which are no longer available from the decomissioned TCGA data portal.
- [ExperimentHub][]{:target="_blank"}: A system for distributing experimental data through Bioconductor. 

*Some websites like DataCamp have a paywall for more advanced courses.

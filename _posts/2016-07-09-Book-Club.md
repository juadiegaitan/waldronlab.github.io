## Stat Learning Book Club

Every Friday at 10 AM EST (subject to change) a group of interested students, researchers, and scholars meet to present, discuss, and learn about topics related to data analysis, statistics, and the R language. At present, we are working through the entirety of *Data Analysis for the Life Sciences* by Rafael A Irizarry and Michael I Love â€“ it is a fascinating text that presents analysis of data in the life sciences through the lens of R programing. We welcome anyone interested to join us by subscribing to our Google Group and *then* (some of the links are private) exploring the links below. Meetings are held both online via Google Hangouts / Adobe Connect and in person at the CUNY School of Public Health (New York, NY). Look forward to seeing you and please feel free to email the group for more information!
